This paper provides a detailed and systematic review of AutoML studies according to the DL pipeline (Figure 1), ranging from data preparation to model evaluation. Additionally, we compare the performance and eciency of existing NAS algorithms on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and provide an in-depth discussion of di erent research directions on NAS: one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS, and joint HAO. We also describe several interesting open problems and discuss some important future research directions. Although research on AutoML is in its infancy, we believe that future researchers will e ectively solve these problems. In this context, this review provides a comprehensive and clear understanding of AutoML for the bene t of those new to this area, and will thus assist with their future research endeavors.
